# THINGS TO DO:
# - Read in LIDAR
# - If obstacle, wait 10 seconds
    # - If the obstacle is still there
        # - If obstacle is on the left
            # - turn 90* clockwise
            # - forward 10"
            # - turn 90* counterclockwise
            # - forward 10" 
            # - turn 90* counterclockwise
            # - forward 10" 
            # - turn 90* clockwise
            # - subtract 10" from distance to travel to point
        # - If obstacle is on the right
            # - turn 90* counterclockwise
            # - forward 10"
            # - turn 90* clockwise
            # - forward 10" 
            # - turn 90* clockwise

            # - turn 90* counterclockwise
            # - subtract 10" from distance to travel to point
    # - If the obstacle is gone -> continue
